// /// <reference types="vite/client" />
// The above line is commented out because the types 'vite/client' could not be found.
// This may indicate that Vite types are not installed or not correctly configured in tsconfig.json.
// If Vite-specific client-side types (e.g., import.meta.env) are used, this will need to be addressed
// by ensuring 'vite' is a dependency and TypeScript can resolve its types.
